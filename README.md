# Office window electricity price forecast

Concept: Can I build a simple model, to give me a decent forecast of the spot electricity prices, just using the weather. 

Background: staring out the office window in Aarhus often, and noticing the wind speed and cloud cover, can I use these two simple factors to get a non crappy prediction of the spot price for the West Denmark zone?
